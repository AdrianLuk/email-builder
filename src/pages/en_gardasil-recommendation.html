          {{customText[I hope you're well. I wanted to take a moment to share some data on how impactful a recommendation from you can be in getting your patients vaccinated.|Ahead of my visit, I just wanted to share some data on the importance of a strong recommendation to vaccinate, which I look forward to discussing with you further.|Thanks for your time and discussing with me how to help ensure patients consider vaccination. Here's some data showing just how important your recommendation can be.]}}
        </p>
        <p>According to a 2010 Canadian survey, 86% of women vaccinated against HPV did so after their physician or pharmacist recommended GARDASIL<sup>&reg;</sup>.<sup>1</sup></p>
        <p>Consider these phrases to shape a clear recommendation for your female patients aged 18-45 to get vaccinated against HPV with GARDASIL<sup>&reg;</sup>9:</p>
        <h3>"Almost all cervical cancer cases are due to HPV"<sup>2</sup></h3>
        <p>Focus clearly on cancer prevention.</p>
        <h3>"It’s estimated that 75% of sexually active Canadians will have at least one HPV infection in their lifetime".<sup>3</sup></h3>
        <p>Reinforce the prevalence of HPV.</p>
        <h3>"I strongly believe in the importance of this vaccine that can help prevent HPV-related cancers."</h3>
        <p>Provide a clear and compelling recommendation regarding vaccination to alleviate any confusion or doubt.</p>
        <h3>Remember, your recommendation counts.</h3>
